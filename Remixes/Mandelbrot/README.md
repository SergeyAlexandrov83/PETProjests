# This code is not mine, I just made some changes to get a cooler looking result (in my subjective opinion)! 

## You can get the original code from this guy: https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV 

I'm not doing this for commercial use, etc. 

I'm still just learning and figuring out this code seemed like an interesting task! 

I'm saving it as I want to implement some thoughts regarding further changes - but first I need to tighten my knowledge in new areas for me a bit! 

p.s. I must not forget to come back to this code later! Peace!

p.p.s. If there are any problems - just contact me!
